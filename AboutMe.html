  <p>Hi I'm Valeria Herrera (she/her) majoring in Interdiscliplinary Education</p>
  <p>In the Arts (IDEAS) hoping to focus on graphic design and minoring in biology and public health.</p>
  <p>I consistently ask myself "What kind of voice and impact do I want to have onto others? I want to inspire others</p>
  <p>in making the world a better place while simultaneously sharing new ideas with each other. I am approaching my</p>
  <p>academic career to be well rounded with a variety of classes connected to my passion and interests.</p>
  <p>This includes social sciences, the arts, the biology of humans and earth we live on, the arts, and environmental</p>
  <p>issues.</p>
